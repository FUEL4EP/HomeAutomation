- 95% Confidence interval: 8.789 .. 9.611


- The 4h moving average results do not show the [typical increase](http://www.opengeiger.de/RadonDuenger/RadonDuenger.html) of  Radon. The sensitivity for alpha radiation of the AL53 sensor may be too low or the fertilizer does not contain uranium. Current, I can't differentiate these two possibilities with my measurement equipment.
