## Sample: 	[Para Nuts (Brazil Nuts)](https://www.aldi-sued.de/de/p.farmer-paranusskerne--g.490000000000054314.html)


- Sample Mass: 128 g

- Sample Volume: [airtight large glass storage jar with clip lock 2 Litres](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B0055KE15A)

- Sample Separation: none

- Measurement duration: 1 months + 1 week

- Date: 01st August 2022 - 8th September 2022

- Note: Para nuts (Brazil Nuts) can be an alpha radiation source depending on the origin. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to eat maximum 2 para nuts per day. See for example [here](https://www.bfs.de/EN/topics/ion/environment/foodstuffs/radioactivity-food/radioactivity-food.html).



## Results

- Measurement interval: 10 minutes
- 7D Moving average event rate: 4.59 cpi
- Maximum 7D moving average event rate: 4.62 cpi
- Maximum event rate: 16 cpi
- 95% Confidence interval width: 4.59 cpi / sqrt(1008) = 0.293 cpi
- 95% Confidence interval: 4.297 .. 4.883


- The 4h moving average results do not show the [typical increase](http://www.opengeiger.de/RadonDuenger/RadonDuenger.html) of  Radon. The sensitivity for alpha radiation of the AL53 sensor may be too low or the fertilizer does not contain uranium. Current, I can't differentiate these two possibilities with my measurement equipment.
