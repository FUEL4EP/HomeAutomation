## IMPORTANT: UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND VALIDATION
- successfully used for all my home brew devices

<br/>
## IMPORTANT: Since this generator software has beta status only, please check the generated install and uninstall scripts very carefully before using them in a production version of an addon. Usage is at your own risk! Thanks. Your feedback and enhancement proposals are welcome! Please let me know if the generator is creating wrong or incomplete install and uninstall scripts. Please send me a PN in such a case: FUEL4EP @ https://homematic-forum.de

# NEWS 9th June 2023:

- adapted [extract_rftypes_XML.groovy](./extract_rftypes_XML.groovy) to support lattest occu release of EQ3
- some required_match_regex expression required an update

# NEWS 2nd June 2021:
- code has been restructured in order to support also subset definitions in rftypes XML
- easymodes references are extracted and the concerning paramset definition are suppressed in the translation XML control file
- option ids are extracted
- the addon generator tends to extract a few more entries than the manually generated install and uninstall scripts e.g. of JP-HB-Devices-addon
- all entries are getting an author specific prefix, e.g. 'F6' in case of FUEL4EP

# NEWS 27th May June 2023:
- the addon generator has been proven to work correctly for 'hb-ep-devices-addon' installed on a RaspberryMatic Aktuelle Firmwareversion: 	3.69.7.20230506
- the addon generator has been validated with occu version: https://github.com/eq-3/occu/commit/a420be85d65df323a6c94efc5b132dbe9a2e3f24  version 3.69.7
- the addon has been developed and tested under Kubuntu 22.04

# Known unsupported features (currently no plan for support)

- Modifications of '/www/rega/esp/channels.htm' are not supported, e..g for 'hb-ou-mot-servo'
- if some extracted options turn out to be unnecessary, please delete them manually in the created XML control file for addon generator [AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml](./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml)

# Short description

- creates the install and uninstall scripts required in [../src/addon/](../src/addon/)
- a singular install 'install_<addon_name>' is newly introduced instead of the previous style of one install script per device
- a singular uninstall 'uninstall_<addon_name>' is newly introduced instead of the previous style of one uninstall script per device

- the following software installations are prerequisites:

	+ install [groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/), a multi-faceted language for the Java platform, on your computer
	+ install [XML Copy Editor](https://xml-copy-editor.sourceforge.io/) on your computer
	+ both groovy and XML Copy Editor are free software and available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Please choose an appropriate source for these software based on your system setup.
	+ a working internet connection is required for updating local data bases to the latest EQ3 repositories from github<br/><br/>
- please follow the following steps to create the addon install and uninstall scripts
        
	+ change your working directory to the [location](./) of this README.md file
	+ ensure that your internet connection is up and running. An update of some required data from EQ'3 occu repository will be done automatically.
	+ ensure that all your addon devices' rftypes XML files are stored in [../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/](../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/)
	+ it is recommended to derive new rftypes XML files from existing ones. Unfortunately some reverse engineering and deep understanding is required for that purpose
	+ if you have trouble, please ask in the Homematic Forum for help
	+ start in a LINUX console  window the script [./make_all.bsh](./make_all.bsh) with the command line option '-run1':
	
        > make_all.bash -run1

	+	this script invocation is
		*	running for several minutes, please be a bit patient ..
		*	storing all outputs during script execution in the log file [run1.log](./run1.log), please use in another console window 'tail -f run1.log' to track the progress
		*  	validating all XML files of [../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/](../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/) against the XML schema file [./libraries/occu.xsd](./libraries/occu.xsd./libraries/occu.xsd) 
			+	potential schema errors will be flagged and need to be fixed before proceeding
			+	the schema file [./libraries/occu.xsd](./libraries/occu.xsd./libraries/occu.xsd) has been extracted from all  rftypes XML files in EQ'3 occu repository <occu repository>/firmware/rftypes/*.xml by the LINUX command 'trang -I xml -O xsd <path_to_local_occu_repository>/*.xml ${LIBRARY_DIR}/occu.xsd'
			+	[./libraries/occu.xsd](./libraries/occu.xsd./libraries/occu.xsd) can also be used to manually validate rftypes XML files with 'xmllint --schema ./libraries/occu.xsd <rftypes XML file> --noout'
		*	downloading the relevant parts of [EQ3'3 occu repository](https://github.com/eq-3/occu) from Github
		*	extracting the used names from the EQ3 occu files reading webui.js, stringtable_de.txt, and translate.lang.stringtable.js
		*	extracting the used names from all rftypes XML files in EQ'3 occu repository <occu repository>/firmware/rftypes/*.xml
		* 	reading previously defined translations of [./libraries/AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file_translation_source.xml](./libraries/AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file_translation_source.xml)
		*	extracting the addon rftypes XML file of  [../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/](../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/)
		*	removing all duplicates of names that are already defined in
			+	webui.js, stringtable_de.txt, and translate.lang.stringtable.js
			+	rftypes XML files in EQ'3 occu repository <occu repository>/firmware/rftypes/*.xml
		*	merging the extracted names of the addon rftypes XML file of  [../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/](../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/) such that duplicates of names are eliminated
		+	creating data bases './libraries/Addon_extract_rftypes_XML_translation_archive.db' and './libraries/EQ3_occu_extract_rftypes_translation_archive.db'
		+	creating the XML control file for addon generator [./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml](./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml)
	+	open and edit the generated XML control file for addon generator [./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml](./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml) with 'xmlcopyeditor
	>xmlcopyeditor  ./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml

	![AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml](./Images/AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml.png  "AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml")


    + then
    	+	check all entries of this control file for completeness and correctness
		+ update the 'addon_name' if needed
		+ update the 'addon_version' if needed
		+ update the 'creator' if needed
		+ replace all undefined device descriptions 'tbd' by the concerning description strings, the URL and HTML encoding for German 'Umlauts' is done automatically
		+ replace all undefined translations 'tbd' by the concerning translation strings, the URL and HTML encoding for German 'Umlauts' is done automatically
		+ save the edited XML control file
		
	+ start in a LINUX console  window the script [./make_all.bsh](./make_all.bsh) with the command line option '-run2':
	
        > make_all.bash -run2

		+	this script invokation is
			* invoking the groovy generator script [AsksinPP_addon_generator.groovy](./AsksinPP_addon_generator.groovy)
			* generating the [addon install script](./install_hb-ep-devices-addon)
			* generating the [addon uninstall script](./uninstall_hb-ep-devices-addon)
	+	please check the generated addon install and uninstall scripts. If they are correct, please copy them manually to the [addon directory ../src/addon/](../src/addon).
	+	copy the edited XML control file for addon generator [./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml](./AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file.xml) to [./libraries/AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file_translation_source.xml](./libraries/AsksinPP_addon_generator_control_file_translation_source.xml]) in order to preserve your latest changes for later generator runs
	+	create device icons with 250x250 pixels and 50x50 pixels png format, e.g. with Gimp, [here](../src/addon/www/config/img/devices/) in the subdirectories '50' and #250', respectively. Crosscheck the png file names with the defined names in [install_hb-ep-devices-addon](./install_hb-ep-devices-addon).
	
	+	if you want solely to validate your newly created rftypes XML files in [../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/](../src/addon/firmware/rftypes/), then start in a LINUX console  window the script [./make_all.bsh](./make_all.bsh) with the command line option '-check':
	
        > make_all.bash -check

		+	this script invocation is validating the XML sytax of your rftypes XML files against the XML schema file  [./libraries/occu.xsd](./libraries/occu.xsd./libraries/occu.xsd) 
	+	potential schema errors will be flagged and need to be fixed before proceeding
	+	the schema file [./libraries/occu.xsd](./libraries/occu.xsd./libraries/occu.xsd) has been extracted from all  rftypes XML files in EQ'3 occu repository <occu repository>/firmware/rftypes/*.xml by the LINUX command 'trang -I xml -O xsd <path_to_local_occu_repository>/*.xml ${LIBRARY_DIR}/occu.xsd'
	+	[./libraries/occu.xsd](./libraries/occu.xsd./libraries/occu.xsd) can also be used to manually validate rftypes XML files with 'xmllint --schema ./libraries/occu.xsd <rftypes XML file> --noout' <br/> <br/> <br/>
	
	
- the following groovy scripts are used by the 'make_all.bsh' script:
	+	[extract_rftypes_XML.groovy](./extract_rftypes_XML.groovy)                                                  
	+	[AsksinPP_addon_generator.groovy](./AsksinPP_addon_generator.groovy) 
	+	please invoke them with the command line option '-h' to see all options for manual execution<br/>
- for pretty printing an XML file a script [make_pretty_print_XML.groovy](./make_pretty_print_XML.groovy) is provided

# final tasks to be done by you

- copy the created install and uninstall script to '<addon_directory>/CCU_RM/src/addon/'
- update the VERSION file '<addon_directory>/CCU_RM/src/addon/VERSION' as needed
- build the addon tgz file by invoking '<addon_directory>/CCU_RM/build.sh'
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: create an system backup of your CCU3/RaspberryMatic before starting any testing with the newly created addon !
- **CAREFULLY test the newly created addon**

# have fun and give feedback

- enjoy! Feedback and improvement suggestions are welcome!
